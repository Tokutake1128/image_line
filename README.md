① About the App
This is an app that extracts edges from images and calculates approximations for straight lines. It's available on Streamlit, so please give it a try.

② Notes
1:To extract edges cleanly, please use images with transparent backgrounds.
2:The algorithm for calculating the approximation formula is created using ChatGPT.
3:Although Fourier series transformation is desired, the app calculates approximations for straight lines due to the heavy computational load of the process.
